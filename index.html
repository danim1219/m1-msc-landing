	<p>
	Sloths, it turns out, aren’t lazy at all. They are doing exactly what they need to do, when they need to do it, to optimize their well-being. We could all learn a thing or two from them.

		<h2> The sloth sleeps an average of 15 hours a day and travels only about 41 meters each day </h2>
	<p>
		They are also super cute!
	</p>

	<h2> They have an unusually low metabolic rate </h2>
	<p>
		 They move slowly and sleep a lot because it takes a long time for their bodies to break down their food and turn it into energy.
	</p>
	<h2> The sloth teaches us that pushing ourselves too hard for too long is a recipe for disaster. </h2>
	<p>
		Listen to your body and mind, and move at the pace that is best for you, even if that pace doesn’t match the others around you.
